And even though some seven million people come annually, few would dispute that each visit is unique \u2013 and something that simply has to be done when in Paris.\n\nHistory\n\nNamed after its designer, Gustave Eiffel, the Tour Eiffel was built for the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World's Fair). It took 300 workers, 2.5 million rivets and two years of nonstop labor to assemble. Upon completion, the tower became the tallest human-made structure in the world (324m) \u2013 a record held until the 1930 completion of New York's Chrysler Building. A symbol of the modern age, it faced opposition from Paris\u2019 artistic and literary elite, and the \u2018metal asparagus\u2019, as some snidely called it, was originally slated to be torn down in 1909. It was spared only because it proved an ideal platform for the transmitting antennas needed for the newfangled science of radiotelegraphy.\n\nSporting six different colors throughout its lifetime, the tower has been painted red and bronze since 1968. Work is underway to strip the previous 19 coats and apply the yellow-brown shade originally conceived by Gustave Eiffel, giving it a new golden hue in time for the 2024 Olympics.\n\nFirst floor: cafe and souvenir shop\n\nOf the tower's three floors, the 1st (57m) has the most space but least impressive views. The glass-enclosed\u00a0Pavillon Ferri\u00e9\u00a0houses an immersion film along with a small cafe and souvenir shop, while the outer walkway features a discovery circuit to help visitors learn more about the tower\u2019s ingenious design. Check out the sections of glass flooring that provide a dizzying view of the ant-like people walking on the ground far below. This level also hosts the restaurant 58 Tour Eiffel. The 1st floor's commercial areas are powered by two sleek wind turbines within the tower.\n\nSecond floor: Le Jules Verne restaurant\n\nViews from the 2nd floor (115m) are the best \u2013 impressively high but still close enough to see the city below. Telescopes and panoramic maps pinpoint locations in Paris and beyond. Story windows give an overview of the lifts\u2019 mechanics, and the vision well allows you to gaze through glass panels to the ground. Also up here are toilets, a souvenir shop, a macaron bar, and Michelin-starred restaurant Le Jules Verne.\n\nTop floor: Champagne bar and 'secret apartment'\n\nViews from the wind-buffeted top floor (276m) stretch up to 60km on a clear day, though at this height the panoramas are more sweeping than detailed. Celebrate your ascent with a glass of bubbly (\u20ac13 to \u20ac22) from the Champagne bar (open 10.15am to 10.15pm). Afterwards peep into Gustave Eiffel\u2019s restored top-level office, otherwise known as the 'secret apartment', where lifelike wax models of Eiffel and his daughter Claire greet Thomas Edison.\n\nTours, tickets and other practicalities\n\nVisitors must pass through security at the bullet-proof glass barriers surrounding the tower's base. The two entrances to the glass enclosure are on avenue\u00a0Gustave Eiffel; the two exits are on quai Branly.\n\nAscend as far as the 2nd floor (either on foot or by lift), from where there's a separate lift to the top floor (closed during heavy winds). Pushchairs must be folded in lifts and bags or backpacks larger than aeroplane-cabin size aren't allowed. Note that the top floor and stairs aren't accessible to people with limited mobility.\n\nPre-purchasing tickets online gives you an allocated time slot and means you only have to queue for security. Print your ticket or show it on your phone. If you can\u2019t reserve your tickets ahead of time, expect lengthy waits for tickets in high season.\n\nStair tickets can't be reserved online. Buy them at the south pillar, where the staircase can also be accessed: the climb consists of 360 steps to the 1st floor and another 360 steps to the 2nd floor.\n\nIf you have reservations for either restaurant, you're granted direct post-security access to the lifts.\n\nFor the best view of the light show, head across the Seine to the Jardins du Trocad\u00e9ro.\n\nHow to get there\n\nThe nearest Metro stop is\u00a0Bir Hakeim, while the nearest train station is\u00a0Champ de Mars\u2013Tour Eiffel (RER C).","subtypes":["Tower"],"top_choice":1,"_index":"5ed57541c35bc948a7490c05","_type":"_doc","_score":null,"_version":null,"_explanation":null,"sort":null,"id":"609e4a2c7a9df8d99504bfcd","highlight":{}},{"score":5,"name":"Centre Pompidou","review_length":3780,"place":"Louvre & Les Halles","ancestor_slugs":["france/paris/louvre-and-les-halles","france/paris","france","western-europe","europe","world"],"internal_ranking":2504.78,"place_atlas_id":"1322719","external_id":"4535346","type":"See","url":"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/pois/372153","attributes":["topchoice","wifi"],"image":"https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2021-05/shutterstockRF_518167564.jpg","coordinates":{"lon":2.352222,"lat":48.860713},"updated_at":"2021-10-16T09:39:18+00:00","atlas_id":"372153","review":"Home to Europe's largest collection of modern and contemporary art, Centre Pompidou\u00a0has amazed and delighted visitors ever since it opened in 1977, not just for its outstanding art collection but also for its radical architectural statement.\u00a0Don't miss the spectacular Parisian panorama from the rooftop.\n\nWhat you can see\n\nThe\u00a0Mus\u00e9e National d\u2019Art Moderne, France\u2019s national collection of art dating from 1905 onwards, is the main draw; a fraction of its 100,000-plus pieces \u2013 including Fauvist, cubist, surrealist, pop art and contemporary works \u2013 is on display. It's located on the 4th and 5th floors.\n\nThe permanent collection changes every two years, but the basic layout generally stays the same. The 5th floor showcases artists active between 1905 and 1970 (give or take a decade). You'll find works by Picasso, Matisse, Chagall, Kandinsky, Arbus, Warhol, Pollock and Rothko here.\n\nThe 4th floor focuses on more contemporary creations, roughly from the 1990s onward, with\u00a0monumental paintings, installation pieces, sculpture and video taking centre stage. The focus here is on contemporary art, architecture and design.\n\nEntered from rue du Renard, the huge Biblioth\u00e8que Publique d\u2019Information (public library) takes up part of the 1st and the entire 2nd and 3rd floors. The 6th floor has two galleries for temporary exhibitions (generally excellent) and restaurant Georges, with sweeping views of Paris.\n\nThere are cinemas and more exhibition space on the ground floor and in the basement. West of the centre, place Georges Pompidou and the nearby pedestrian streets attract buskers, musicians, jugglers and mime artists. South of the centre, on place Igor Stravinsky, are fanciful mechanical fountains of skeletons, hearts treble clefs and a big pair of ruby-red lips, created by Jean Tinguely and Niki de Saint Phalle.\n\nCentre Pompidou for children\n\nOn the 1st floor, the Galerie des Enfants, open from 11am to 7pm Wednesday to Monday, is an exhibition area aimed at children aged two to 10, which encourages interactive experimentation; various workshops take place on Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFor teenagers aged 13 to 16, Studio 13/16, open 2pm to 6pm Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday on the lower ground floor, has visual, multimedia and performing art kits and opportunities to meet artists.\n\nThe building\n\nFormer French President Georges Pompidou wanted an ultra-contemporary artistic hub, and he got it: competition-winning architects Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers effectively designed the building inside out, with utilitarian features, such as plumbing, pipes, air vents and electrical cables, forming part of the external fa\u00e7ade, freeing up the interior space for exhibitions and events. The building was renovated in 2020.\n\nTickets and other practicalities\n\nCentre Pompidou opens late every night (except Tuesday, when it\u2019s closed), so head here around 5pm to avoid the daytime crowds.\u00a0Admission to the museum is free on the first Sunday of each month.\u00a0Rooftop entry is included in museum and exhibition admission; alternatively, buy a panorama ticket (\u20ac5) just for the roof.\u00a0You'll still have to queue to get through security, but the entry process will go faster if you buy museum and events tickets online.\n\nAudio-guided tours are downloadable on its website (you'll need your own smartphone and earphones). Guided tours in English take place at 2pm on Saturday and sometimes Sunday (\u20ac4.50; reserve online).\n\nThe museum is wheelchair accessible with a step-free entry at the south side of building at the corner of Rue du Renard and Rue St Merri. There are elevators inside to get between floors.\n\nThe nearest metro station is\u00a0Rambuteau.","subtypes":["Museum"],"top_choice":1,"_index":"5ed57541c35bc948a7490c05","_type":"_doc","_score":null,"_version":null,"_explanation":null,"sort":null,"id":"5f7765ee82ecd3250d302d54","highlight":{}},{"score":5,"name":"Sainte-Chapelle","review_length":3316,"place":"The Islands","ancestor_slugs":["france/paris/the-islands","france/paris","france","western-europe","europe","world"],"internal_ranking":2504.316,"place_atlas_id":"1322509","external_id":"4501761","type":"See","url":"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/pois/1193683","attributes":["topchoice"],"image":"https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2021-05/shutterstockRF_793919728.jpg","coordinates":{"lon":2.345463,"lat":48.855207},"updated_at":"2021-10-16T09:37:15+00:00","atlas_id":"1193683","review":"Visit Sainte-Chapelle on a sunny day when Paris \u2019 oldest, finest stained glass (1242\u201348) is at its dazzling best. The chapel is famous for its stained-glass windows, holy relics, and concerts.\n\nEnshrined within the city's original, 13th-century Palais de Justice (Law Courts), this gem-like Holy Chapel is Paris\u2019 most exquisite Gothic monument, completed in 1248. It was conceived by Louis IX to house his personal collection of holy relics, including the famous Holy Crown. Some 70% of the stained glass, covering a total area of 640 square meters, is original. To understand the biblical stories illustrated in the 1113 scenes, view or 'read' the windows from left to right, and from bottom to top.\n\nHistory\n\nSainte-Chapelle was built in the courtyard of the royal palace on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9\u00a0as a sacred space to house Louis IX's collection of Christian artefacts. The famous Ste-Couronne (Holy Crown) was\u00a0acquired by the French king in 1239 from the emperors of Constantinople for a sum of money easily exceeding the amount it cost to build the chapel. Formerly safeguarded in the treasury at Cath\u00e9drale Notre Dame de Paris, the wreath of thorns was transferred to a safe inside the Louvre for safekeeping following the devastating cathedral fire of April 2019.\u00a0Sainte-Chapelle was built in just six years (compared with nearly 200 years for Notre Dame) and consecrated in 1248.\n\nInsider tips\n\nJoin a free 1\u00bd-hour guided tour in English (daily between 11am and 3pm); rent a 30-minute audioguide (\u20ac3); or download the Sainte Chapelle smartphone app to explore all 1113 windows in luxuriant, intricate detail.\n\nSainte-Chapelle's location within the Palais de Justice (Law Courts) means extra-tight security; be sure to leave pocket knives, scissors et al at your accommodation.\n\nClassical- and sacred-music concerts held here are a soul-stirring experience really not to be missed. Check schedules and buy tickets at Fnac.\n\nTours, tickets and accessibility\n\nFree 45-minute guided tours (only in French) depart from the information desk at the far end of the ground-floor bookshop daily at 11am and 3pm. Audioguides (30 minutes) cost \u20ac3, or download the Sainte-Chapelle Windows smartphone app. Entry is free on the first Sunday of the month from November to March.\n\nSkip long queues at Sainte-Chapelle by purchasing a combination ticket next door at Conciergerie, allowing you to join the shorter 'priority access' queue at the chapel.\n\nThe number of visitors in wheelchairs is capped at two visitors per floor. There's an accessible entrance on Boulevard du Palais. The lower chapel is accessible by an access ramp, while access to the high chapel is by an elevator in the adjacent building. Visitors can avail of an adapted wheelchair. Toilets are wheelchair-friendly. It's advisable to make a reservation for assistance in advance.\n\nWhat's nearby?\n\nCath\u00e9drale Notre Dame de Paris is about a 10-minute walk away. Local dining is typically geared towards tourists and office workers. That said, pretty Place Dauphine is home to several eateries, including bistro Ma Salle \u00e0 Manger.

The Louvre\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre is essentially to present Western art (primarily French and Italian, but also Dutch and Spanish) from the Middle Ages to about 1848 \u2013 at which point the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay takes over\u2013as well as works from ancient civilisations that formed the West's cultural foundations.\n\nHistory\n\nLong before its modern incarnation, the vast Palais du Louvre originally served as a fortress constructed by Philippe-Auguste in the 12th century; it was rebuilt in the mid-16th century as a royal residence in the Renaissance style. The Revolutionary Convention turned it into a national museum in 1793.\n\nWhen the museum opened in the late 18th century it contained 2500 paintings and objets d\u2019art; the \u2018Grand Louvre\u2019 project inaugurated by the late president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in 1989 doubled the museum\u2019s exhibition space, and both new and renovated galleries have opened in recent years devoted to objets d\u2019art such as the crown jewels of Louis XV. The Islamic art galleries are in the restored Cour Visconti.\n\nTickets and other practicalities\n\nThe sheer size of the place can be overwhelming. However, there\u2019s an array of self-guided thematic trails (1\u00bd hours; download trail brochures in advance from the website) ranging from a Louvre masterpieces trail to the art of eating, plus several for kids (hunt lions, galloping horses).\n\nEven better are the Louvre\u2019s self-paced multimedia guides (\u20ac5). More formal, English-language guided tours depart from the Hall Napol\u00e9on, which has free English-language maps.\n\nThe main entrance is through the 21m-high Grande Pyramide, a glass pyramid designed by the Chinese-American architect IM Pei (1917\u20132019).\n\nStandard tickets are \u20ac15. The only way to guarantee entry is by booking online (\u20ac2 surcharge) or making a time-slot reservation through the Paris Museum Pass. You can avoid the longest queues (for security) outside the pyramid by entering the Louvre complex via the underground shopping centre Carrousel du Louvre, or the Porte des Lions entrance. If you don't have a pre-bought ticket, you'll need to queue up again to buy your ticket once inside (not recommended at peak times, when capacity can mean anyone without a prior reservation won't get in). Tickets are only valid for the duration of your visit (you can no longer come and go as you please throughout the day).\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Louvre introduced new measures such as timed-tickets and a ban on cash.

In 1785, the subterranean tunnels of an abandoned quarry were upcycled as storage rooms for the exhumed bones of corpses that could no longer fit in the city's overcrowded cemeteries\u2014now it's one of Paris\u2019 most visited sights.\n\nHistory\n\nAs the cemeteries became a public health concern, officials decided to move their contents to a site that was, at that time, outside the capital. The first evacuations happened from 1785 to 1787, from the Saints-Innocents cemetery, a site that had been in use since the Middle Ages and closed in 1780. At first, the human remains were simply piled into the quarry. However, before opening to the public in 1809, there was a decorative restoration of the ossuary. By 1810 the skull- and bone-lined catacombs\u2014resting place of millions of anonymous Parisians\u2014had been officially born.\n\nLes Catacombes refers to the part of underground quarry that became the publicly accessible ossuary. However, the term catacombs is often used colloquially to refer to the more vast underground network of tunnels under Paris. These underground tunnels have remained a storied part of Parisian history: during WWII the Resistance held meetings there. Today, at night, thrill-seeking cataphiles roam the tunnels illegally.\n\nTickets and other practicalities\n\nIn a visit to the official site, visitors will cover\u00a01.5 km (about 1 mile) of the underground tunnels on an hour-long visit. The route through Les Catacombes begins at its spacious 2018-opened entrance av du Colonel Rol-Tanguy. Walk down 131 spiral steps to reach the ossuary itself, with a mind-boggling amount of bones and skulls of millions of Parisians neatly packed along the walls.

Online bookings are pricier but include an audioguide and guarantee a timeslot, whereas standing in the queue does not, as online ticket holders have priority.\n\nBag searches are carried out to prevent visitors from taking bones.","subtypes":["Cemetery"],"top_choice":1,"_index":"5ed57541c35bc948a7490c05","_type":"_doc","_score":null,"_version":null,"_explanation":null,"sort":null,"id":"5f77691382ecd3be4030233f","highlight":{}},{"score":5,"name":"Mus\u00e9e Rodin","review_length":2667,"place":"St-Germain & Les Invalides","ancestor_slugs":["france/paris/st-germain-and-les-invalides","france/paris","france","western-europe","europe","world"],"internal_ranking":2503.667,"place_atlas_id":"1322788","external_id":"3828111","type":"See","url":"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/pois/372149","attributes":["topchoice"],"image":"https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2021-05/LPI-25973-25.jpg","coordinates":{"lon":2.316098,"lat":48.855793},"updated_at":"2021-10-16T08:50:50+00:00","atlas_id":"372149","review":"Even if you're not an art lover, it is worth visiting this high-profile art museum to lose yourself in its romantic gardens.\n\nSculptor, painter, sketcher, engraver and collector Auguste Rodin donated his entire collection to the French state in 1908 on the proviso that it dedicate his former workshop and showroom, the beautiful 1730 H\u00f4tel Biron, to displaying his works.

Since 1958 the palace has housed the S\u00e9nat, the Upper House of French Parliament, which is occasionally visitable by guided tour. East of the palace is the Italianate, 1630-built Fontaine des M\u00e9dicis, an ornate fish pond.\n\nNearby, the heavily guarded H\u00f4tel du Petit Luxembourg was the modest 16th-century pad where Marie de M\u00e9dici lived while the Palais du Luxembourg was being built.

The Tuileries soon became the most fashionable spot in Paris for parading about in one\u2019s finery.

The two oval rooms of the purpose-built top floor are the show-stealer; here you'll find eight of Monet's enormous, ethereal Water Lilies canvases bathed in natural light.\n\nDownstairs is the private collection of art dealer Paul Guillaume (1891\u20131934), with works by all the big names of early modern art: C\u00e9zanne, Matisse, Picasso, Renoir, Modigliani, Soutine and Utrillo.
