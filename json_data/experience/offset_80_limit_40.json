For this reason, and unlike other bike tours of Versailles, we limit our groups to 14 people. We also warmly welcome you at our very own caf\u00e9, and our guide rides the train to Versailles with you- so you\u2019re taken care of the whole way. Join our family for a day, and experience our version of Versailles!\n\nWe\u2019ve planned an unforgettable day trip from Paris, cruising through the town of Versailles for the amazing local market, heading into Versailles\u2019 grounds & gardens, Marie Antoinette\u2019s village, and the Trianons. After the picnic, we make our way to the Chateau. You\u2019ll then explore the palace at your own pace.\n\nOur tour makes history accessible. It\u2019s about getting the juicy important details of Versailles plus the fun stories and quirky anecdotes. It\u2019s simply about an unforgettable day in the countryside, tickets included",

Because there is no way to get her all to yourself, we\u2019ve done the next best thing: As the museum starts to close and everyone else rushes for the doors, we take advantage of the natural thinning of crowds. Entering at this time, you\u2019ll find the room almost totally empty so you can get up close to the great lady for a peaceful 20 minute visit with your guide. Of course you\u2019ll see the best of the rest too. You\u2019ll spend 3 hours viewing the very best artwork in the Louvre with an art historian, learning what makes these masterpieces so world-renowned. ",
