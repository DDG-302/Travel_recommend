Because there is no way to get her all to yourself, we\u2019ve done the next best thing: As the museum starts to close and everyone else rushes for the doors, we take advantage of the natural thinning of crowds. Entering at this time, you\u2019ll find the room almost totally empty so you can get up close to the great lady for a peaceful 20 minute visit with your guide. Of course you\u2019ll see the best of the rest too. You\u2019ll spend 3 hours viewing the very best artwork in the Louvre with an art historian, learning what makes these masterpieces so world-renowned. \n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: From July 21st 2021, all sites in Paris that we visit during our tours are requiring clients and guides alike to provide proof of vaccination or a negative test within the past 48-hours for entry. You can read more about it on the French Government website.",
